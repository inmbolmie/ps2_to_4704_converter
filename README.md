Modified TMK Keyboard Firmware Collection
=========================================

This TMK fork has been modified to provide the keyboard converter nobody ever asked for: PS/2 keyboard to IBM 4704 host
This is experimental and unfinished code

It also has been added a converter to use XT/AT/Terminal keyboards with an original 5251/3278 keyboard, in conjunction with the Save-a-Term hardware, https://github.com/inmbolmie/Save-a-Term
